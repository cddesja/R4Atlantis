\title{Required initial variables}
\source{
SETas_model_New example data from Atlantis Wiki
}
\usage{
required
}
\description{
This data set adds the required initial conditions variables to the user-specified ones based on the \code{gen_init} and the functional group csv. These were extracted from the initial nc file from the SETas_model_New example.
}
\details{
The required data set was created by extracting the required tracer, phys, and epibenthos variables from \code{init_vmpa_setas_25032013.nc}. This is just raw text that was read in using the \code{readLines} function on the uncompressed nc file. To see this data in user readable format, see the example.
