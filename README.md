# Please see the [R for Atlantis](https://github.com/r4atlantis) group page instead. The code below is not maintained. 

R4Atlantis is a set of helper functions for creating, manipulating, and viewing Atlantis files from R. This package is a collaboration of researchers at the University of Iceland, NOAA, and the Institute of Hydrobiology and Fisheries Science in Hamburg. 

At present, this package can generate initial conditions files and dummy hydro data, it can query and interact with Fishbase to extract parameters, writes part of the biology submodel, and can be used to view/extract Atlantis output. The development of this package is ongoing and API is subject to change (i.e. break) until initial CRAN release. Feedback and/or request for additional functionality is welcomed.  

To install: 

```R
library(devtools)
install_github(repo = "cddesja/R4Atlantis")
```
